# Return of the object 

### Marisa Olson 

### Curator: Václav Janoščík 

### 11.9.-6.11.2015 

While the advent of the Internet, among other things, has shifted our interest and focus onto virtual immaterial space, there has been a significant impact it had on our physical world. The supposed elusiveness of virtual existence has a tremendous effect on aesthetic but also environmental issues. In such a situation we need to address these processes. We need to turn to the object.

Virtual space is no longer a novelty; rather it forms an intimate part of our culture. Marisa Olson addresses precisely this shift with her notion of Post-Internet. The return to the object presents one of forms of this process. Our experience with the Internet is being inscribed within the objects around us.

*"There doesn't seem to be a need to distinguish, any more, whether technology was used in making the work - after all, everything is a technology, and everyone uses technology to do everything. What is even more interesting is the way in which people are starting to make what I've called "Post-Internet" art in my own work ..." Marisa Olson*

Facing things in our surroundings, we usually have quite a precise idea about what to do with them. They have their use, unlike the art piece that seems to be purposeless. Art often leaves us uneasy and anxious. But the situation seems to be changing particularly when reflecting the Internet. The circulation and proliferation of objects affects not only virtual but also material objects.

The exhibition tends to address this uneasiness and even abundance of objects. It outplays a space for both astonishment and settlement among the objects. The unequivocal turn to the object evolves into a tune into it.

*“Sometimes you get fascinated by the object that [that object] represents” Martin Kohout*
